If somebody else added a project to the git root folder, this will not automatically appear in your MCUXpress workspace!

In order to get it, you have to Import this project intpo existing workspace. This can be done by using the 

"Import Project(s) from filesystem ..."  in the Quickstart Panel of the MCUXpressoIDE.
